# Customer Default Risk Segmentation and Analysis
This project focused on segmenting and analyzing customer financial data for a credit card provider to predict default behaviour of its users allowing the company to improve it's lending strategies and reduce financial risk

### Project Objective
To segment customers based on credit risk and financial behavior, identify predictors of default, and generate actionable insights that optimize credit policies, reduce financial losses, and enhance retention of valuable customers. By completing this project, stakeholders identify default risk users and prevent them before it happens through strategies and policies for targeted credit risk management

### Project Background
Banks and micro-lending institutions face increasing challenges in predicting customer credit risk, leading to higher default rates and reduced profitability. Traditional credit assessments often fail to incorporate behavioral indicators such as utilization trends and late payment frequency, causing organizations to underestimate emerging risks in customers

This project analyzes customer financial and behavioral data to segment clients based on their risk of default. By examining factors like credit utilization, payment history, and demographic details, it reveals which customer groups are most likely to default. The analysis helps identify early warning signs, such as frequent late payments, enabling targeted strategies to reduce defaults and protect financial loss. The interactive Power BI dashboard makes these insights easy for decision-makers to explore and act on, improving credit risk management and customer retention

### Business Needs
- Spot high-risk customers early to reduce default losses and protect the company’s revenue.
- Make smarter lending decisions by using real behavioral data such as payment patterns and how much credit customers use.
- Support customers before they default with targeted repayment plans and personalized assistance.
- Protect profits while keeping valuable customers, especially those who carry some risk but have high future value.
- Improve cash flow by using early-warning alerts and monitoring systems that reduce bad debt.
- Build stronger investor and partner confidence with transparent, data-driven risk management practices.
- Grow the business responsibly by managing risk effectively without losing good customers or market opportunities

### Tools and Skills Used
- Power BI (interactive Dashboards, DAX, visuals, KPIs)
- Excel (Statistical Analytics)
- Data Transformation
- Credit Risk Analytics
- Segmentation Analytics

### Key Findings:
- High credit utilization and low credit scores are strong predictors of default risk.
  
- Customers with "Fair" credit scores and credit utilization between 0.80–0.99 contribute disproportionately to total defaults.
  
- Late payment frequency serves as a reliable early-warning indicator of default, with customers in the "Fair" credit score segment showing the highest likelihood of repeated late payments.
  
- Moderate-risk customers represent the highest Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), indicating that targeted retention and credit risk management strategies could yield significant returns
  
- Employed customers has the biggest potential in terms of CLV(315M) but has the highest default rate with 35.02%
  
- Customers after the age of 60 years old provide the highest risk of default rate yet have a lower late payment habit.
  
### Strategic Recommendations:
- Prioritize intervention for customers with credit utilization above 0.70 and “Fair” credit scores. Create an automated monitoring system that flag these accounts weekly. Use targeted outreach (email, SMS, or phone) offering reduced interest rates for partial repayment, or a gradual credit limit reduction to manage risk without alienating customers.

- Leverage late payment frequency as an early-warning trigger for “Fair” and "Good" credit score customers. Set up an alert system that automatically sends payment reminders after the first missed payment and offers flexible payment dates or hardship support after the second.
  
- Protect moderate risk, high lifetime value customers with tailored retention initiatives. Design personalized credit counselling sessions, loyalty perks for on-time payments, or short-term credit restructuring offers to keep them engaged while reducing default risk.
  
- Reassess credit terms for employed customers with high CLV but also high default rates. Offer tiered repayment plans based on income level, and use data monitoring to detect sudden spending spikes for early intervention
  
- Address higher default rates in customers over 60 years with targeted support rather than restrictions. Conduct proactive income verification every 12 months, and offer emergency hardship plans for customers facing sudden financial changes.
  
- Use segmentation driven collections and risk management allocation. Assign high touch strategies (personal calls, dedicated account managers) to top-risk/high-value groups, while lower risk customers can be managed through automated monitoring and reminder systems. High CLV customers should be targetted and restrictions for low CLV should be tighten for those meeting Risky Tier.

- Regularly Review and Refine Segmentation Based on Dynamic Behavior
Monitor changes in utilization, payment behavior, and risk scores over time to detect customers moving into higher-risk categories early. This enables pre-emptive communication before default risk crystallizes.
